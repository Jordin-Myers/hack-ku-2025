<h2>🔐 DeFi & Payments Safety Checklist</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>1. Validate All Contract Addresses</h3>
  <p>
    Always confirm that the contract address you're interacting with is official. Use trusted sources like verified DeFi dashboards, project websites, or blockchain explorers.
  </p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>✅ Check the address on the project's official site</li>
    <li>✅ Compare with listings on CoinGecko, Etherscan, or XRPL Explorer</li>
    <li>✅ Avoid shortened or obfuscated links</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>2. Protect Your Seed Phrase & Private Keys</h3>
  <p>
    Your seed phrase is the master key to your wallet. If someone has it, they have full access to your funds.
  </p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>✅ Never enter your seed phrase into a website</li>
    <li>✅ Store it offline in a secure location</li>
    <li>✅ Use encrypted backups and avoid taking screenshots</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>3. Use Hardware Wallets for Significant Funds</h3>
  <p>
    Hardware wallets isolate your private key from the internet, drastically reducing the risk of hacks or malware theft.
  </p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>✅ Only buy wallets from official vendors</li>
    <li>✅ Confirm transactions on the device screen</li>
    <li>✅ Avoid using hardware wallets on public computers</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>4. Confirm Audit & Security Reviews</h3>
  <p>
    Many DeFi platforms undergo smart contract audits to ensure security. Only use platforms with reputable audits.
  </p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>✅ Check for third-party audit reports (e.g., Certik, Trail of Bits)</li>
    <li>✅ Read user feedback on Twitter or Reddit</li>
    <li>✅ Avoid new projects with anonymous teams and no audits</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>5. Be Skeptical of Airdrops, Giveaways, and Promises of Free Money</h3>
  <p>
    Scams often use urgency and rewards to trick users into signing malicious transactions or giving up credentials.
  </p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>✅ Don’t connect your wallet to unknown dApps</li>
    <li>✅ Never pay to claim an airdrop</li>
    <li>✅ Double-check project legitimacy on social media and forums</li>
  </ul>
</div>
